# fullstack_movie_app
This is a basic fullstack crud app to cement my knowledge at eda

this is just CRUD practice with react-redux, adding new movies, removing movies, updating movies and rendering movies

i might add database capibilites just for a refresher

also want to use this as an opportunity to get better at testing
